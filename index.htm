<h2>What's all this?? - FAQ's</h2>
<div class="centered">
<p>So you have been on the internet for a while..you have been to numerous websites..perhaps you even want a website of your own..or are planning about it..but you have certain doubts..if that's so..then you have come to the right place..Click on the questions for the answers :)</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Q. Why do i need a website?</dt>
	<dd><span>Long answer short: Cause everyone does!</span>
    Ok, well, to elaborate further, who doesn't have a website these days? The guy at the corner table in office, your friends and even your neighbours have websites..So shouldn't you too?
    You are probably working,and looking to earn some more, or you are planning to startup a business. Having an online presence is VERY important for the success of any company, whether small or big.
    Or you might be a creative student, looking to showcase your talents on the big stage, or a fresher looking for jobs and wanting an online resume. Or you might be wanting a site for your college symposium, or for your marriage, or your...wait..whoever you are..you NEED a website.
    And thats where we come in :) We design and develop stunning websites for you at extremely affordable rates.
    Having an own personalised website is no longer restricted to only the geeks and nerds, you can have your very own website up and running in a few days' time.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Q. So what do you charge?</dt>
    <dd>
    Well that depends on what you want :) give us a call up or request for a quote and we will get back to you within a few hrs with a custom made quote suiting your needs. And to give a solid answer to your question, our very basic websites start at Rs.1099 (that's 20$ for you), cant believe it yet? Go on,ask our customers and read their testimonials :)
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Q. Why is the cost so low?? Whats the catch?</dt>
    <dd>There is NO catch :) we are not doing this commercially, it is for extra credits and to gain work experience.In fact, we prefer working with people who are referred to us by our customers and/or friends. So if you are here, you can be rest assured that you will get your site at the quoted price and nothing more :)
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Q. So do you have any samples I can look at?</dt>
    <dd>Of course!! Thats what we built this site for :) Have a look at our portfolio </dd>
